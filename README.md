# iLovePlates

iLovePlates is a platform under development made for a hospital to maintain check weather there is an available parking space for doctors.

My solution aims to solve the problem for the hospital; where students or people posing as visitor for patient's family park their vehicle and there is a shortage of space of parking for doctors.
